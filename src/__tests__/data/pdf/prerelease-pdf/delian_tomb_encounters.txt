GOBLIN GUARDS
The heroes battle goblins outside the Delian Tomb.
• At the start of combat, there are six goblin warriors.
These warriors act in groups of two.
• At the start of the second round of combat, a goblin
underboss, a goblin assassin, and two goblin warriors
emerge from the entrance of the tomb, appearing
anywhere you choose within 3 squares of the entrance.
The two warriors are in a group, and the underboss and
assassin are in another.

E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add two goblin warriors to the start of
the encounter.
• For four heroes, remove two goblin warriors at the
start of the encounter.
• For three heroes, remove four goblin warriors at the
start of the encounter.
TACTICS
During the first round, the goblin warriors use the Goblin
Mode malice feature at the start of the first round of combat
to give everyone a speed boost. Then the warriors run at
the hero closest to them, taking the Charge action with
Spear Charge to close the gap if necessary. If they don’t
have to charge, each uses the Bury the Point action until
you run out of Malice. As the goblins attack, they shout for
help.
During the second round of combat, the assassin uses
Shadow Chains to attempt to restrain any melee warriors
and the underboss uses Get Reckless, spending the extra
Malice to avoid the ability’s negative effects, and then
attacks the toughest-looking hero with Swordplay. All
remaining warriors get close to an opponent using Spear
Charge and then attempt to back away out of the fray, using
hit and run tactics.
A SHLEIGH
Ashleigh isn’t much help in a fight. Because of her non-
threatening status, the goblins ignore her while there are
still heroes to contend with. She hides behind a tree in the
starting area of the battle and stays there.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
The goblins fight until after the second wave arrives and
they are outnumbered two to one. They then flee—at which
point encounter is over, and the heroes earn 1 Victory each.
F LEEING F OES
If the heroes wish to give chase at the end of an encounter when
their foes flee, go around the table and have each hero narrate
how they catch up to an enemy and deliver a finishing blow until
all the enemies are dealt with.

B RAZIER
Each time a creature touches the heavy iron brazier or

TACTICS
The spinecleavers run at the heroes and try to push them
into the brazier with their attacks while the snipers stay
near the edges of the room, moving around to get clear
shots and away from melee combatants as much as
possible. The warriors wade into the fray, targeting melee-
focused characters first and using Bury the Point as often as
Malice allows before retreating to get out of reach. The
goblins use their ability to climb to get around their
opponents, clawing up and over them on walls and ceilings.

2 Two ghouls

SKULL S IGIL
The skull sigil animates the dead in this room. The sigil is an
object with 80 Stamina and corruption, poison, and psychic
immunity all and holy weakness 5. Whenever the sigil takes
damage, each creature in a space that touches the sigil takes
1d6 lightning damage.
When the sigil is destroyed, the undead in this room die.
As a maneuver, a hero can make an easy Reason test to
examine the skull:
• ≤11: The hero must connect their mind to skull’s magic
to discover its nature. Doing so causes 5 psychic damage
to the hero, but they also learn that the symbol is what’s
causing the dead to rise in this room and keeping them
animated.
• 12-16: The hero knows that the symbol can cause the
dead to rise in this room and keep them animated.
• 17+: As 12-16 except the hero can choose to deal 10
damage to the sigil as part of the test.
E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add two skeletons.
• For four heroes, remove two ghouls. The sigil has 60
Stamina.
• For three heroes, remove four ghouls. The sigil has 40

TACTICS
These undead are mindless and lack much in the way of
tactical thinking. Each undead creature targets the closest
enemy they can on their turn. The ghouls run into the fray,
leaping at targets to knock them down. Skeletons remain at
range to shoot targets with their bows. The zombies use
Zombie Dust as Malice allows, typically at the start of their
turn so they can stand after using it.
The undead do not leave this room.

The undead fight until destroyed. If the heroes destroy the
undead or the skull sigil, they earn 1 Victory.

• For three heroes, remove one group of two goblin
warriors and one goblin warrior and the four
spinecleavers the warrior captained.
STAIR WARD
The magic ward that covers the stairs makes the floor in
this room immune to all damage and indestructible.
When a creature touches the ward, any forced movement
currently affecting them ends as if they had hit a wall, they
take 3 lightning damage, and they are teleported up to 5
squares away into an unoccupied space of your choice that
doesn’t include the ward (typically a place that is far from
where the creature would like to be).
The ward can be overcome with the Amulet of the Delian
Order (see Treasure). If the ward is lifted, the heroes can
enter the second level of the Delian Tomb (see Tomb
Second Level in Part 2: Broadhurst and Environs).
VIOLET
While Violet, a civilian, is in the room and the channeler is
alive and perfomring the ritual, Violet can’t regain stamina,
her speed is 0, and she loses 2 stamina at the end of each
round once combat starts. If her stamina drops to 0 in this
way, she dies and the ward to the stairs is destroyed in a
brilliant crackle of lighting.
A hero who can reach Violet can cut her free or untie her as
a maneuver. A hero carrying Violet who has a Might score
of 1 or lower is slowed while they carry her. Removing
Violet from the room or defeating the channeler ends the
effects on her.
The goblins avoid harming Violet, since they want the ritual
to kill her. While under the effect of the ritual, she is
considered a goblin and their ally for the purposes of the
goblin’s abilities and Malice features.
The Delian Tomb © 2025 MCDM Productions, LLC
TACTICS
Depending on how the heroes approach from area D3, they
may catch the goblins surprised. Likewise, the goblins may
be ready for the heroes and catch them surprised.
As the heroes engage, Vorgosh the channeler bellows, “The
Cup of Iulius shall make the legions of Queen Bargnot
strong!” and gets back to chanting. On her turn, she uses
Blistering Element if the heroes are bunched together or
Shadow Drag if they’re spread apart to pull targets toward
her to grab or onto the ward. If she is grabbing someone,
she throws them onto the ward. She uses Twist Shape on
any creature who gets close to freeing Violet.
The spinecleavers run into the fray and attempt to push the
heroes into the ward or toward the channeler.
Each warrior attacks a different target, trying to prevent
the heroes from reaching Violet or the channeler.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
The goblins fight until the channeler falls and then flee—at
which point encounter is over, and the heroes earn 1
Victory each if they save Violet.

Murkik uses Stone Wave and Tile Slide to keep the heroes
away from him and separated while shouting orders to the
other dwarves and reminding them not to kill anyone. The
warden corners the toughest melee combatant they can get

The trappers split up, concentrating on restraining as many

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add one human brawler to the start of
the encounter.
• For four heroes, remove eight human guards from the
start of the encounter.
• For three heroes, remove one human brawler and eight

FARMER R UN
The farmers (five civilians) are slowed and take their turn
at the end of each round. They move as quickly and as
carefully as they can, attempting to get to the south end of
the map. Once they reach the south end of the map, they are
safe.
A hero can use a maneuver to encourage a farmer to drop
what they are holding. The farmer listens and drops their
crops as a free triggered action, ending the slowed
condition for them.
REINFORCEMENTS
At the start of the second round of combat and each
subsequent round, a human brawler captaining four
human raiders appears on an edge of the map of your
choice. These creatures are in their own group.
WELL
The well at the center of the town is 4 squares deep and has
less than 1 square of water in it.
TACTICS
The bandits harm whichever creature is closest to them,
prioritizing attacking heroes if they are equidistant from a
hero and a farmer. The humans spend malice on Exploit
Opening when they can to gain an edge.
The brawlers attempt to grab targets with Haymaker and
the Grab maneuver so they can benefit from their Shoot the
Hostage trait. The raiders take the Charge action to engage
foes and then fight until that foe falls before moving on to
the next. The guards move into position so they can be
flanked and make additional free strikes.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
The encounter ends when all the farmers have either died
or are safe and off the encounter map, at which point the
remaining bandits flee. If the heroes save at least three of
the farmers, they earn 1 Victory.

TACTICS
At the start of the encounter, each member of the Gilded
Hand picks a rival for their Rivalry trait who has a class that
matches their own or comes close. For example, Bodorff
Buckfeather would pick a conduit, but if none is available
he might pick a censor or troubadour.
Gorek wades into the fray against their rival if they can,
with Boddorff close behind to provide support and
maximize the use of their Stalwart Guardian trait. Mara
uses the Earth Devours to target as many creatures as she
can. If she can’t get at least two heroes with the ability, she
uses The Writhing Green instead. She also is sure to use
Jaws of the Void to stay out of melee combat.
When the rivals have lots of Malice to spend, they use
Coordinated Takedown.

REINFORCEMENTS
At the start of the second round, eight rotting zombies
and two ghouls emerge from the tangled roots in the
center of the room.
E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add four memorial ivies to the initial
group and four rotting zombies to the reinforcements.
• For four heroes, remove four memorial ivies from the
initial group and four rotting zombies and a ghoul from
the reinforcements.
• For three heroes, remove the reinforcements.
OBELISK C HAMBER F EATURES
Ceiling: The ceiling in this chamber is 6 squares high.
Balcony: A horseshoe-shaped balcony rings part of this
room. It’s 2 squares up from the floor, and accessible by
ladders on its south side. Each side of the balcony (north,
west, and east) has six supporting pillars. If three or
more of these pillars are destroyed, that side of the
balcony collapses (see Collapse!).
Tangled Roots: An area that is 6 squares on a side in the
center of the room is difficult terrain. The heroes’
enemies in this room ignore this difficult terrain.
C OLLAPSE!
If a creature is on or underneath a balcony when it
collapses, they must make an Agility test, suffering the
following effects for being on the balcony when it collapses.
If the creature is under the balcony, they suffer the same
effect but take an extra 3 damage.
• ≤11: 9 damage, M<2 restrained (save ends) and prone
• 12-16: 5 damage, M<2 prone
• 17+: The creature can immediately shift up to 2 spaces,
after which they take 2 damage. If the creature does not
move out of the footprint of the balcony, they take 5
damage instead.
If the northern balcony collapses, it blocks the passage
north out of this room. It takes the heroes 10 minutes of
work outside of combat to excavate the tunnel forward.
TACTICS
The tomb horror aims to stay in the center of the room,
pulling creatures into the difficult terrain there to make it
harder for them to reach the memorial ivies on the balcony,
who spread out and use their favorable vantage point
combined with their pull to disrupt the heroes’ positioning.
Meanwhile, the ghouls and zombies target anyone who
tries to reach the balcony, or who uses ranged attacks to try
and eliminate the memorial ivies. If all the ivies fall, they
instead defend the tomb horror.
If a hero tries to rush through the room and down the
corridor ahead, the tomb horror uses and action and their
vine-like appendages to grasp and tear down the northern
balcony, either blocking the way, or trapping the hero
inside.

and at least half the other creatures in the encounter have
been dispatched. Completing this encounter earns each

E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add two creeping sludges as their own
group.
• For four heroes, remove a creeping sludge and four
black ichors.
• For three heroes, remove a creeping sludge, four black
ichors, and both gelatinous balls.
PUSHED INTO THE GAUNTLET
It is possible a creature make be force moved into the
gauntlet (see D11. The Gauntlet). When a creature starts
their turn in the gauntlet, or enters it for the first time on
their turn, they take 5 damage.
H AND ON THE REINS
The crawling claw was created for the sole purpose of
working the control panel. On their turn, the claw triggers
dart traps in the room, targeting two creatures in the main
room of this area. Each target must make an Agility test:
• ≤11: 9 poison damage, M<3 weakened (save ends)
• 12-16: 7 poison damage, M<2 weakened (EoT)
• 17+: 5 poison damage
The tunnel to reach the control panel is a very tight
squeeze, and the position of the control panel makes
ranged attacks against the hand nearly impossible. A
creature of size 1S or larger trying to get through it must
make an Agility test when they enter or start their turn in
the tunnel:
• ≤11: The creature takes 2 damage per space they move
through the tunnel and can move at half speed down the
tunnel this turn.
• 12-16: The creature can move at half speed down the
tunnel this turn.
• 17+: The creature can move at full speed down the
tunnel this turn.
While a creature is squeezing down the corridor, strikes
against them gain a double edge.
If the crawling claw is removed from the controls, a hero
adjacent to the controls can use an action to use them
against the monsters. They can also turn off the gauntlet
from here.
TACTICS
The oozes aim to force heroes back into the gauntlet if they
can, to dispatch them more ably. However, they’re
otherwise not especially tactical. Thanks to their
amorphous trait, they pursue heroes down the narrow
tunnel to the south with ease, and the creeping sludges can
pull creatures out of that tunnel, reverting some of their
progress on reaching the control panel.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
Once the heroes secure the control room, the oozes flee and
the heroes earn 1 Victory each.

temporary Stamina equal to the absorbed ooze’s remaining
Stamina.
Gush ◆ 5+ Malice
An ooze in the encounter thrashes and sputters in a 1 burst area.
The ooze makes a free strike against each adjacent enemy and
object within distance. The ground within or beneath the affected
area is considered difficult terrain for enemies and deals 3 acid
damage whenever an enemy enters an affected square or starts
their turn there. The area increases by 1 for every 2 malice spent
on this feature.

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add a second human trickshot as their
own group.
• For four heroes, remove eight human raiders.
• For three heroes, remove sixteen human raiders.
H EROES S TART
There is no place on the reference map for the heroes to
start if the alarm is raised, since they might get caught
anywhere in or near the fort. Use your best judgment in
giving them a place to start.
FORT DOOR
The entry to the fort remains open unless there is an attack.
In that case, a series of wooden planks are pulled into place.
This door has 40 Stamina and can be forced open with a
moderate Might test:
• ≤11: The door does not budge.
• 12-16: The door begins to break. One more test with a
result of 12+ brings it down.
• 17+: The door falls aside.
C OOKFIRE
The first time a creature touches the cookfire in the mess
tent on a turn or starts their turn touching it, they take 2
fire damage.
TRAINING G ROUNDS
In the center of the fort’s open courtyard, fighting dummies
and archery targets sit waiting to be pummeled, shot, or
stabbed as part of the bandits’ training regimen. Each
dummy has sharp spear and dagger extensions that are
harmless when training. A creature force moved into a
space containing a fighting dummy takes an additional 5
damage, and then the dummy is destroyed.
TACTICS
If the heroes are outside the palisade when the alarm is
raised, then the trickshot, archers, and rogues climb to the
top of the palisade and prepare ranged strikes against
oncoming heroes while the scoundrel and raiders put up
the fort door then stand before it and await intruders.
If the heroes are inside when the alarm is raised, raiders
and the scoundrel move to engage them in melee while the
rest of the humans use ranged abilities. The bandits spread
the damage around, hoping to hamper all the heroes at
once instead of one at a time.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
When the heroes outnumber the bandits, the remaining
bandits flee and each hero earns 1 Victory.

5 Glass spider (blue; optional)
6 Glass spider (indigo; optional)
7 Glass spider (violet; optional)
SPIDER, O RBS, AND M IRRORS
The connections between the globes, spiders, and mirrors
are detailed here:
• Each colored mirror corresponds to similar-colored
globe (and spider when they transform): red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
• When a spider is destroyed, the next orb in the sequence
transforms into a spider that attacks the heroes.
• If a mirror is smashed when its companion globe is still
in globe form, that globe cannot turn into a spider.
• Each mirror has 5 Stamina and is immune to poison and
psychic damage.
• The globes are immune to all damage while in globe
form. Once a globe becomes a spider, that mirror cannot
be damaged.
• When the spider is defeated, the associated mirror
shatters on its own. A creature within 1 square of a
mirror that shatters this way takes 3 damage.
LEARNING THE C ONNECTION
Observing the interaction between the globes, spiders, and
mirrors can provide information on they work. If the
players don’t figure it out on their own, a hero passing a
moderate Reason test can gain knowledge:
• ≤11: The hero learns nothing from this test.
• 12-16: The hero learns the first two bullet points from
Globes, Spiders, and Mirrors.
• 17+: The hero learns all the bullet points from Globes,
Spiders, and Mirrors, and all their power rolls against the
spiders and mirrors have an edge.
E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has three or four heroes, make the
following adjustments:
• For four heroes, only the red and orange glass spiders
appear at first.
• For three heroes, only the red and orange glass spiders
appear at the start of the encounter. Each glass spider in
the encounter has 40 Stamina.
STARTING POSITIONS
There is no map to indicate starting positions in this
encounter, since the heroes could be anywhere on the floor
when they trigger the encounter. The spiders appear in any
unoccupied space within 7 squares of the heroes when
they’re activated.
TACTICS
The spiders move to harm creatures attempting to escape
up the stairs or harm the mirrors in the room first, using
Web to restrain their foes. The spiders use Trample or
Burst of Glass when they have lots of Malice to spare,
attempting to harm as many heroes as possible.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
When the heroes have defeated the war spiders, either by
defeating them or breaking the mirrors before they appear,
they can freely search the room. Each hero gains 1 Victory
for defeating the spiders.

1 Ogre goon (Forg)
2 Ogre juggernaut (Gruul)
3 Four mohlers (minion squad)
4 Four mohlers (minion squad)
5 Four mohlers (minion squad)
E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add eight mohlers.
• For four heroes, remove eight mohlers.
• For three heroes, remove eight mohlers at the start of
the encounter. Additionally, Forg is out hunting. He
returns to the tower and enters the combat as Gruul is
defeated.
M OHLER C AGE
If a creature is pushed into one of the mohler cages, the
door can be shut and the creature trapped inside. Each cage
has 25 Stamina and is immune to poison and psychic
damage. If a creature is inside a cage when it is destroyed,
they take 2 damage. A creature outside the cage who can
reach it can unlock it as a maneuver.
A creature cannot unlatch the door from the inside unless
they make a moderate Agility test as a maneuver:
• ≤11: The door does not open.
• 12-16: The door opens, but the lock is destroyed. The
door can’t be locked again.
• 17+: The door opens and creatures inside can exit.
Future attempts to open the latch from the inside have a
double edge.
M AGICAL H OLE
The hole cannot be entered, as it is drawing energy from a
different dimension. The first time on a turn that a creature
enters a space adjacent to the hole or starts their turn
there, they must make a moderate Might test:
• ≤11: The creature’s speed becomes 0 until the start of
their next turn. If they fail this test three rounds in a row,
they turn to stone for as long as they remain adjacent to
the hole. While stone, a creature has damage immunity
10 and they are unconscious. If left this way for 24 hours,
a creature becomes stone permanently.
• 12-16: At the end of this turn, the creature is slowed
(save ends).
• 17+: The creatures can move and must no longer pass
this test for the next 24 hours.
C APTIVES
The four civilians here are terrified and do nothing other
than take the Defend action at the end of each round unless
the heroes intervene. If a hero uses a maneuver to shout
out at a civilian within 5 squares, that civilian instead uses
their turn to head toward the second floor.
The people here know the same information as the people
on the second floor, with the following additions:
• Bassa the stonemason is upstairs with an orc
elementalist.
• They explain the danger of the magic hole in the wall (see
Magic Hole).
• Strange magic, like the hole in the wall here, affects the
top floors of this tower.
TACTICS
The ogres have straight forward tactics, attempting to force
move the heroes into cages, the hole in the wall, or each
other. They don’t care if they harm civilians, but as long as
both ogres are alive, they focus on harming the heroes. Forg
uses Grabby Hand each turn and People Bowling when he
has a creature grabbed and the Malice to Spend. Gruul uses
Pitchfork Catapult or Earth Breaking Jump and Horrible
Bellow as often as possible. When the ogres have lots of
Malice, they use Bully.
When one ogre is dead, the other uses Rampage and starts
harming the closest creatures, including any civilians.
The mohlers spread out to harm as many heroes as
possible. They’re trained not to harm any captives.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
When the heroes defeat the ogres, the mohlers stop
attacking and return to their cages, cowering. If at least half
the civilians survived the ordeal, the heroes earn 1 Victory
each.

preferably another elementalist, as the target of his Rivalry

lycanthropy. She must bite him twice to achieve this.

caught surprised, she focuses her efforts on harming the
heroes, focusing her attention to use Accursed Bite on one
hero and spending Malice to attempt to inflict lycanthropy.

6 Two goblin cursespitters
E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add two goblin warriors.
• For four heroes, remove two goblin warriors.
• For three heroes, remove two goblin warriors and one
group of a goblin underboss and four goblin
spinecleavers.
B UILDINGS ON FIRE
When the heroes enter the square, the blacksmith, butcher,
and cobbler shops are on fire.
Each round when the goblin snipers take their turn, four of
the snipers all target the same building of your choice,
lighting it on fire. If fewer than four goblin snipers remain,
they can’t target a building.
A hero who is adjacent to the well can use a free maneuver
to pull up a bucket of water. A hero holding a bucket of
water can hurl it at a burning building up to 10 squares
away to douse the flames as a maneuver.
At the end of each round, roll 1d6 for each burning building
and add 1 for the number of rounds the building has been
burning, including the current round. On a result of 6 or
higher, the building collapses.
When a building collapses, each creature within 2 squares
of it must make an Agility test:
• ≤11: The creature takes 7 fire damage.
• 12-16: The creature takes 5 fire damage.
• 17+: The creature takes 3 fire damage.
After a building collapses, the ground it occupies becomes
difficult terrain. For the rest of this encounter when a
creature enters a square of this difficult terrain for the first
time on a turn or starts their turn there, they take 1 fire
damage.
WELL
The well at the center of the town is 4 squares deep and has
less than 1 square of water in it.
TACTICS
The underboss, the spinecleavers, warriors, and
underbosses move to surround the heroes, attempting to
keep them away from the well and burning buildings. They
focus fire on heroes who grab buckets. The goblins use
Malice to activate Tiny Stabs once the heroes are
surrounded to maximize damage.
Four snipers attempt to burn buildings and the remaining
snipers each attack a different target, prioritizing those
furthest from the melee. The cursespitters also fight at
range, using Eye of Surlach to weaken foes on the front line.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
The goblins fight until the heroes outnumber them two to
one, and then they flee. If two or fewer buildings collapsed
during the fight, the heroes earn 1 Victory each.

E NCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add a goblin warrior riding a worg who
carries a civilian captive.
• For four heroes, remove a goblin warrior and a worg
and a civilian.
• For three heroes, remove two goblin warriors and two
worgs and two civilians.
FREEING THE C APTIVES
Each of the eight worg-riding goblins has a captive on their
back, a restrained civilian. While restrained, the civilian
can occupy the same space as a goblin riding a worg.
While a goblin has a captive on their back, they attempt to
reach the south end of the map, leaving the encounter if
they move off that edge of the map with the captive. If a
goblin loses their captive, they turn and fight the heroes
instead.
A hero who is adjacent to a restrained captive can use a
maneuver to free a captive, pulling them off the worg into
an unoccupied adjacent square and ending the restrained
condition for that captive. If a captive is force moved, they
are similarly freed.
Each freed captive acts at the end of the round, moving
toward the closest edge of the map that they can while
avoiding danger. If they move off the edge of the map, they
are safe and leave the encounter. The goblins favor
targeting the heroes over freed captives, but they don’t
mind if a captive gets caught in the crossfire.
WELL
The well at the center of the town is 4 squares deep and has
less than 1 square of water in it.
TACTICS
Goblins drawn into the battle have straight forward tactics.
The assassins and warriors move around the battlefield
with their worgs, running in and out of melee while the
stinkers ride around the edge of the battlefield and attempt
to keep the heroes away from still-captive civilians.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
Goblins and worgs without captives fight until the heroes
outnumber the whole group two to one, and then they flee.
If at the heroes save at more than half of the civilians, they
earn 1 Victory each. If they save every civilian, they earn 2
Victories each.

• For three heroes, remove a group of eight goblin

E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
The goblins fight until Queen Bargnot and one of the war
spiders are reduced to 0 Stamina, then they flee. The heroes
earn 2 Victories each for winning the day.
TACTICS
Queen Bargnot uses her Handaxe ability to allow the
spiders to make free strikes. She and the snipers remain
atop the spiders to maintain high ground and gain an edge
on strikes against creatures lower than them. Bargnot stays
adjacent to an ally whenever she can so she can continue to
use Meat Shield. She also spends Malice on each of her
turns to use Get in Here.
The goblin runners leap of the backs of the war spiders to
get the benefit of the war spider’s Ride Launcher trait. They
spread out to attack as many heroes as possible. The
spiders typically move into position to target as many
heroes as possible with Web and then use Leg Blade or use
Trample if Malice allows to harm as many creatures as
possible.

• For four heroes, remove six goblin runners and one

A RCHER’S STAKES
The courtyard is surrounded by archer’s stakes pointing
both inward and outward.
ARCHER ’S S TAKES L EVEL 1 F ORTIFICATION DEFENDER
EV 2
A series of sharp stakes have been placed into a palisade to protect
defenders against charges and other attacks. The stakes point in one
direction, towards the front of the object.
Stamina: 3/square
Size: 1 or more squares of difficult terrain, generally 4x1
Direction: a specific side of the stakes are defined as the front
Disable: Only through destruction of each square of stakes.
Trigger: A creature moves into a square of stakes.
Effect: The triggering creature takes 2 damage per square of
stakes they move through and an additional 3 damage the
movement is forced movement.
Allied Awareness
Allies of this object ignore the difficult terrain, damaging effects
unless force moved, and benefit from cover in a square of archer’s
stakes.
TILTED TOWERS
The beams holding up the tower were made to fall apart. A
creature can use their action to remove a tower’s beams
and then move out of the way. Alternatively, they can be
destroyed after taking 6 or more damage.
When a tower falls, each creature within 10 squares of the
tower must make an Agility test. Each affected goblin has an
edge on the test.
• ≤11: The creature is crushed under the rubble. They take
9 damage and are restrained (save ends).
• 12-16: The creature is battered by debris. They take 6
damage.
• 17+: The creature manages to get out of the way. They
move up to their speed to the closest unoccupied square
of their choice outside of the affected area. If they can’t
move to such a space, treat this as 12-16 result.
The affected area becomes difficult terrain.
TACTICS
When the heroes cross the threshold into the courtyard, the
goblins have two approaches. The underbosses command
the runners to push them towards the edges of the maps
and into the stakes. The snipers start combat hidden in the
heaps and open fire when the heroes least expect it. If the
heroes are particularly tough, the goblins lure the heroes
back towards the towers.
The warriors knock down one tower per round trying to hit
as many heroes as possible. Afterwards, they pick on any
opponents that are caught in the rubble.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
At the end of the third round, any remaining goblins in the
courtyard retreat inside the keep while the snipers and
stinkers flee, ending the encounter. The heroes earn 2
Victories each.

IVY OR NOT
The ivy in this room is sturdy enough to climb without a
test and reaches the ceiling. If the memorial ivy remains
motionless, it’s indistinguishable from regular ivy for
heroes and villains alike. While a creature is climbing a
memorial ivy, the memorial ivy is considered climbing the
creature as well.
TACTICS
The goblins duck and weave between the pillars and climb
up every vertical surface they can grasp to surround and
suppress the heroes. Cravard command severyone’s
attention, even barking commands at the heroes to run or
surrender, and enabling the assassins to sneak up behind
the backline heroes.
The goblins’ main goal is to wear down the heroes before
they reach Queen Bargnot, but any goblins that have been
transformed by the Cup of Iulius also want to show off their
newfound power. They should feel inspired and
encouraged to finally stand toe to toe with the heroes.
TARGON A PPEARS
If Targon of the Gilded Hand brought Queen Bargnot the
Cup of Iulius, he appears in the barracks at the start of the
second round of combat. He stays behind the goblins and
uses ranged abilities and then attempts to flee when he is
winded.
E NDING THE E NCOUNTER
The goblins fight until only two goblins remain, who
proceed to flee and leave the encounter and castle. The
memorial ivies are aggressive until they are destroyed. The
heroes earn 2 Victories each.

M YSTIC GOBLINS
Imbued with the power of the Cup of Iulius, these goblins
have become super charged soldiers. They’ve grown larger
and now embody the might of the warriors of old.
Queen Bargnot already leads an imposing number of
goblins within the Jagged Edge. If enough of them were to
sip from the sacred cup, she could take claim to the entire
region all on her own.
TRANSFORMED
The mystic goblins are transformed versions of the
following goblins:
• The goblin assassin has become the goblin shadowknife
• The goblin cursespitter became the goblin deathtongue
• The goblin stinker has become the goblin toxinaut
• The goblin underboss became the goblin mastermind
• The goblin warrior has become the goblin battleborn
• Queen Bargnot, who originally used the goblin monarch
stat block, has become Mystic Queen Bargnot
