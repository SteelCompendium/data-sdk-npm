needs a miniature or virtual token to represent their hero
and a way to roll dice.

Each combat encounter ncludes a map that shows the

this adventure also has a sheet that goes along with it to help you
run things more smoothly at the table.
THE S TORY S O F AR
A virulent goatpox has struck the local goat population in
Broadhurst. No one in the small farming village has the
knowhow or the resources to fix the problem. But an
enterprising trio in the nearby town of Wend has a solution.
Torrance, a merchant with a bleeding heart, is originally
from Broadhurst, and his family goat farm is the epicenter
of this pox. He’s teamed up with his once teenaged
paramour from the same hometown, an eccentric but
brilliant alchemist named Myrna and her husband Hector, a
penny-pinching herbalist. The latter two have brewed a
medicine that cures the pox. Torrance has a sturdy
merchant’s cart and an old nag that could make the journey
to Broadhust. There’s been rumors of bandit raids and
goblin attacks on the road, so they also need some guards.
KICKING THINGS OFF
Give the players the following bulleted information. When
you see information presented in bullet points with
quotation marks around it, that information is meant to be
shared with the players through reading or paraphrasing it
aloud.
• “You were hired just over a day ago to protect this
wagon, carrying valuable medicine, on its journey west
from Wend to Broadhurst.”
• “Torrance, the bleeding-heart merchant, ducks into the
wagon seat while Myrna, the brilliant alchemist, and
Hector, the miserly herbalist, lock themselves in the
back.”
• “Tell us what everyone is looking at. Who are you? Tell us
your name, ancestry, class, and a bit about what they
look like, their personality, and why they chose to
become a hero.”
Have each player introduce their hero. Some might choose
to do so in the third person. Others might get into character
and act like their hero making an introduction. Either
approach or anything in between is great. Whatever makes
the players most comfortable.
DALRATH
Wend and Broadhurst are in the barony of Dalrath, ruled by the
benevolent Lord Kenway. An occasional monster or threat of war
emerges from the wodes and mountains that surround the
barony, but most folks in the region live simple, mundane lives.
Dalrath is part of Vasloria, a continent on the world of Orden.
This adventure takes place entirely on the road from Wend to
Broadhurst, so you can feel free to change the world where these
villages are set to suit your needs.
MEDICINE W AGON
The wagon the heroes guard uses the following rules, which
is on the Medicine Wagon handout you should give to the
players.
• The wagon has three weight classifications, each defined
how many crates it holds. Holding 0-1 crates is light, 2-4
crates is medium, and 5 or more crates is heavy.
• The wagon starts with 5 medicine crates.
• If a hero holding a crate takes damage, the crate is
destroyed instead.
• The wagon has 30 Stamina.
If the wagon loses all of its crates, the group who hired the
heroes wish to press on to Broadhurst and plan to make
new medicine while there at the village.
P ART 1: R AT R AIDERS
After the players introduce their heroes, give them the
following information:
• “FWIP! An arrow pierces the side of the medicine wagon!
The rain pours down in sheets, but the sudden sound of a
Road to Broadhurst © 2025 MCDM Productions, LLC
pan pipe whips up over the din and they emerge—
threatening shapes slicked with mud.”
• “Your wagon is mired in the mud and carries five heavy
crates of valuable medicine. It’s sunk too deep to move,
and you may need to lighten the load.’”
• “The bandits, as they draw closer, have tails and
elongated, furry faces—ratfolk.”
• “From inside the wagon, hector peeps, ‘Don’t let them
steal any medicine. We at least need to break even on
this trip!’”
The bandits are radenwights, acrobatic, highly coordinated,
and devious ratfolk. They are led by Tix, a radenwight
maestro. He has eight radenwight mischievers, eight
radenwight swiftpaws, and eight radenwight redeyes
with him.
• The radenwights are after whatever’s in that wagon.
They have no interest in killing, but attempt to subdue
those who stand in their way.
• The mischievers and swiftpaws will attempt to steal
crates of medicine from the wagon.
This encounter uses the Rainy Road map.

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS
If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:
• For six heroes, add four radenwight mischievers.
• For four heroes, remove four radenwight michievers.
• For three heroes, remove four radenwight michievers
and four radenwight swiftpaws.
UNHEROIC TRIO
The trio that hired the heroes isn’t much help in a fight, and
the radenwights don’t consider them a threat. They’ve
hidden in the wagon. Hoping their money was well spent.
TACTICS
During the first round, the mischievers and swiftpaws use
Rat Race to get close to the heroes and attempt to
overwhelm and surround the cart while stealing crates. The
redeyes attack heroes trying to recover stolen crates. Tix
stays near the edge of the battlefield, enhancing his
minions, starting with his Overture villain action. He keeps
a few minions close by so he can take advantage of Rat
Rondo.
At the start of the second round of combat, the hidden
mischeivers group emerges from the woods,
attempting to steal crates. The minions attempt to keep
the heroes contained while they take advantage of Ready
Rodent to whittle them down.
ENDING THE ENCOUNTER
The encounter ends when the radenwights have escaped
the map with three crates or the heroes kill Tix, after which
the remaining radenwights flee. If the heroes kill Tix before
the radenwights steal three crates, each hero gains 1
Victory. If they kill Tix before any crates are stolen, each
hero gains an additional 1 Victory.
FLEEING FOES
If the heroes wish to give chase at the end of an encounter when
their foes flee, any attempt ends in failure as the heroes are
bogged down in mud and rain while they scurry into hidden
warrens beneath the ground.
A GOOD I NVESTMENT
As Torrance, Myrna, and Hector emerge from the wagon,
Myrna teases Hector, about not wanting to spend money on
guards. Hector is still skeptical, asking the heroes,“ Did we
lose any crates?” He’s relieved if the answer is no. If the
answer is yes, he grumbles that they could lose their shop.
R ADENWIGHT M ALICE M ALICE FEATURES
At the start of any radenwight’s turn, you can spend malice to activate
one of the following features.
Trouser Cut (Main Action) (Non-minion) ◆ 2d10 +2 ◆ 3 Malice
Keywords Melee, Strike, Weapon
Distance Melee 1 Target One creature
✦ ≤11 7 damage; push 3
★ 12–16 10 damage; push 3; taunted (EoT)
✸ 17+ 13 damage; push 5; taunted (EoT)
Effect If a target is wearing clothing covering the lower half of
their body, they must use a maneuver to pull that clothing up
before they can move.
Rat Race ◆ 5 Malice
Each radenwight shifts up to their speed. Wherever a radenwight
ends this movement adjacent to at least one other radenwight,
they can make a melee free strike against each adjacent enemy.
Rally the Rodents ◆ 7 Malice
A radenwight uses music to coordinate rats to form a 10 wall of
living rats scurrying atop one another into unoccupied spaces
anywhere on the encounter map. The wall doesn’t block line of
effect for radenwights and their allies, but it does for other
creatures, as the rats coordinate their movements with the
radenwights. Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina. If the last
radenwight in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the
rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy on the
encounter map makes an Intuition test.

F REEING THE W AGON
Before the journey can continue, Torrance asks the heroes
to get the wagon unstuck. Any hero helping free the wagon
should make a Might test. The hero who gets the highest
result determines the outcome for the group. If the wagon
is heavy they take a bane on the roll. If the wagon is light
they gain an edge on the roll.
• ≤11: The wagon is freed, but a crate is dropped and
destroyed in the process.
• 12-16: The wagon is freed.
• 17+: The wagon is quickly freed and the next hero to
make a power roll gains an edge on the test.
P ART 2: D AYS OF R AIN
The heroes have days of travel ahead with no relief from
the weather. They have to help keep the cart moving to get
to Broadhurst in time to save some goats.
MONTAGE TEST : KEEP
MOVING
The heroes must perform a montage test to keep the wagon
moving, forage the forest for supplies, and prevent any
potential threats from manifesting. The success and failure
limits of this test are listed on the Keep Moving Test
Difficulty table.
