            <effect>Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following benefits:
- Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target becoming size 3. Each creature who is within the target&apos;s new space slides to the nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability. If the target doesn&apos;t have space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until the effect ends.
- They have fire immunity 10.
- Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score.
- When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced movement distance gains a +2 bonus.
- They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for Might power rolls.</effect>
