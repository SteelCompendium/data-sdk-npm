    icon: ⭐️
    effects:
      - effect: The werewolf’s ferocity is expressed through rage. Their abilities are
          capable of inflicting rage points on enemies (excluding stormwight
          furies). If a creature has 10 or more rage at the start of their turn,
          they expend all of their rage, shift up to their speed towards the
          nearest creature, and make a melee free strike against them. A
          creature that takes damage in this way gains 1 rage. All accumulated
          rage disappears after completing a respite.
