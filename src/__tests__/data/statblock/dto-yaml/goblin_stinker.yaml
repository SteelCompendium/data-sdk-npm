        effect: The area is filled with a green haze until the start of the stinker’s
          next turn or until the stinker is reduced to Stamina 0. The area is
          difficult terrain for non-goblin creatures, and each such creature who
          moves within the area takes 2 poison damage for each square moved. The
          haze can’t be dispersed by wind.
