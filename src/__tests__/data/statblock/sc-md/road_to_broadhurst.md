##### THE STORY SO FAR

A virulent goatpox has struck the local goat population in
**Broadhurst. No:** one in the small farming village has the knowhow or the resources to fix the problem. But an enterprising trio in the nearby town of Wend has a solution. Torrance, a merchant with a bleeding heart, is originally from Broadhurst, and his family goat farm is the epicenter of this pox. He’s teamed up with his once teenaged paramour from the same hometown, an eccentric but brilliant alchemist named Myrna and her husband Hector, a penny-pinching herbalist. The latter two have brewed a medicine that cures the pox. Torrance has a sturdy merchant’s cart and an old nag that could make the journey to Broadhust. There’s been rumors of bandit raids and goblin attacks on the road, so they also need some guards.

##### KICKING THINGS OFF

Give the players the following bulleted information. When you see information presented in bullet points with quotation marks around it, that information is meant to be shared with the players through reading or paraphrasing it aloud. • “You were hired just over a day ago to protect this wagon, carrying valuable medicine, on its journey west from Wend to Broadhurst.” • “Torrance, the bleeding-heart merchant, ducks into the wagon seat while Myrna, the brilliant alchemist, and Hector, the miserly herbalist, lock themselves in the back.” • “Tell us what everyone is looking at. Who are you? Tell us your name, ancestry, class, and a bit about what they look like, their personality, and why they chose to become a hero.” Have each player introduce their hero. Some might choose to do so in the third person. Others might get into character and act like their hero making an introduction. Either approach or anything in between is great. Whatever makes the players most comfortable.

##### DALRATH

Wend and Broadhurst are in the barony of Dalrath, ruled by the benevolent Lord Kenway. An occasional monster or threat of war emerges from the wodes and mountains that surround the barony, but most folks in the region live simple, mundane lives. Dalrath is part of Vasloria, a continent on the world of Orden. This adventure takes place entirely on the road from Wend to Broadhurst, so you can feel free to change the world where these villages are set to suit your needs.

##### MEDICINE WAGON

The wagon the heroes guard uses the following rules, which is on the Medicine Wagon handout you should give to the players. • The wagon has three weight classifications, each defined how many crates it holds. Holding 0-1 crates is light, 2-4 crates is medium, and 5 or more crates is heavy. • The wagon starts with 5 medicine crates. • If a hero holding a crate takes damage, the crate is destroyed instead. • The wagon has 30 Stamina. If the wagon loses all of its crates, the group who hired the heroes wish to press on to Broadhurst and plan to make new medicine while there at the village. PART 1: RAT RAIDERS After the players introduce their heroes, give them the following information: • “FWIP! An arrow pierces the side of the medicine wagon! The rain pours down in sheets, but the sudden sound of a pan pipe whips up over the din and they emerge— threatening shapes slicked with mud.” • “Your wagon is mired in the mud and carries five heavy crates of valuable medicine. It’s sunk too deep to move, and you may need to lighten the load.’” • “The bandits, as they draw closer, have tails and elongated, furry faces—ratfolk.” • “From inside the wagon, hector peeps, ‘Don’t let them steal any medicine. We at least need to break even on this trip!’” The bandits are radenwights, acrobatic, highly coordinated, and devious ratfolk. They are led by Tix, a radenwight maestro. He has eight radenwight mischievers, eight radenwight swiftpaws, and eight radenwight redeyes with him. • The radenwights are after whatever’s in that wagon. They have no interest in killing, but attempt to subdue those who stand in their way. • The mischievers and swiftpaws will attempt to steal crates of medicine from the wagon. This encounter uses the Rainy Road map.

##### Rat Raiders Groups


##### Group Creatures

1 Four radenwight mischievers (minion group) Four radenwight mischievers (minion group) 2 Four radenwight swiftpaws (minion group) Four radenwight swiftpaws (minion group) 3 Four radenwight redeyes (minion group) Four radenwight redeyes (minion group) 4 One radenwight maestro

##### ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make the following adjustments: • For six heroes, add four radenwight mischievers. • For four heroes, remove four radenwight michievers. • For three heroes, remove four radenwight michievers and four radenwight swiftpaws.

##### UNHEROIC TRIO

The trio that hired the heroes isn’t much help in a fight, and the radenwights don’t consider them a threat. They’ve hidden in the wagon. Hoping their money was well spent.

##### TACTICS

During the first round, the mischievers and swiftpaws use
**Rat Race:** to get close to the heroes and attempt to overwhelm and surround the cart while stealing crates. The redeyes attack heroes trying to recover stolen crates. Tix stays near the edge of the battlefield, enhancing his minions, starting with his Overture villain action. He keeps a few minions close by so he can take advantage of Rat

##### Rondo.

At the start of the second round of combat, the hidden mischeivers group emerges from the woods, attempting to steal crates. The minions attempt to keep the heroes contained while they take advantage of Ready Rodent to whittle them down.

##### ENDING THE ENCOUNTER

The encounter ends when the radenwights have escaped the map with three crates or the heroes kill Tix, after which the remaining radenwights flee. If the heroes kill Tix before the radenwights steal three crates, each hero gains 1 Victory. If they kill Tix before any crates are stolen, each hero gains an additional 1 Victory.

##### FLEEING FOES

If the heroes wish to give chase at the end of an encounter when their foes flee, any attempt ends in failure as the heroes are bogged down in mud and rain while they scurry into hidden warrens beneath the ground.

##### A GOOD I NVESTMENT

As Torrance, Myrna, and Hector emerge from the wagon, Myrna teases Hector, about not wanting to spend money on guards. Hector is still skeptical, asking the heroes,“ Did we lose any crates?” He’s relieved if the answer is no. If the answer is yes, he grumbles that they could lose their shop.

##### RADENWIGHT MALICE MALICE FEATURES

At the start of any radenwight’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

##### Trouser Cut (Main Action) (Non-minion) ◆ 2d10 +2 ◆ 3 Malice


##### Keywords Melee, Strike, Weapon


##### Distance Melee 1 Target One creature


##### ✦ ≤11 7 damage; push 3


##### ★ 12–16 10 damage; push 3; taunted (EoT)

##### Effect If a target is wearing clothing covering the lower half of

their body, they must use a maneuver to pull that clothing up before they can move.
**Rat Race:** ◆ 5 Malice Each radenwight shifts up to their speed. Wherever a radenwight ends this movement adjacent to at least one other radenwight, they can make a melee free strike against each adjacent enemy. Rally the Rodents ◆ 7 Malice A radenwight uses music to coordinate rats to form a 10 wall of living rats scurrying atop one another into unoccupied spaces anywhere on the encounter map. The wall doesn’t block line of effect for radenwights and their allies, but it does for other creatures, as the rats coordinate their movements with the radenwights. Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina. If the last radenwight in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy on the encounter map makes an Intuition test.

##### End Effect

At the end of their turn, the maestro can take 5 damage to end one save ends effect affecting them. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.

##### FREEING THE WAGON

Before the journey can continue, Torrance asks the heroes to get the wagon unstuck. Any hero helping free the wagon should make a Might test. The hero who gets the highest result determines the outcome for the group. If the wagon is heavy they take a bane on the roll. If the wagon is light they gain an edge on the roll. • ≤11: The wagon is freed, but a crate is dropped and destroyed in the process. • 12-16: The wagon is freed. • 17+: The wagon is quickly freed and the next hero to make a power roll gains an edge on the test. PART 2: DAYS OF RAIN The heroes have days of travel ahead with no relief from the weather. They have to help keep the cart moving to get to Broadhurst in time to save some goats.
**MONTAGE TEST:** : KEEP

##### MOVING

The heroes must perform a montage test to keep the wagon moving, forage the forest for supplies, and prevent any potential threats from manifesting. The success and failure limits of this test are listed on the Keep Moving Test Difficulty table.

**Total Failure::** The journey was truly awful and the wagon is in worse shape. The wagon loses 1 crate or the wagon takes 5 damage, and the heroes lose 1 Recovery.

##### HORRIFYING RELIEF

The weather breaks, giving the heroes some temporary relief and a chance to interact with the Torrance, Myrna,

##### and Hector.

• Torrance is steely in his resolve, practically ready to give the medicine away at this point. He just wants to help. “My folks are really hurting. I’m sure we can spare a crate for them.” • Myrna is the only one having a good time. She loves getting down and dirty in the mud. “I’m used to being covered with grime and soot, so this is a welcome change!” • Hector is regretting this entire fool’s errand and is constantly complaining. “I’m sorry about your family, Torrance, but be should’ve never left Wend. We’re going to be ruined if we don’t end up dead first.”

##### HAG STORY

If you’re running part 3 of this adventure, run this interlude to set up that section. You can skip this interlude if you don’t plan to run part 3. As the heroes camp, Torrance challenges them to tell the best ghost story around the campfire. After one or two heroes offer up a scary story, Torrance shares a local legend, about an old witch that lives in the woods they are traveling through. • “’Her name is Catty Goutfinger,’ says Torrance. ‘She’s 14 feet tall with fingers like spears and teeth as long and grey as nails. She wears a necklace made of living eyes and a dress made from clacking fingerbones. And she keeps two hundred cats as pets.’” • “’The village of Khashton (Hah-uhsh-ton) had a rat problem. Food was blighted, people were sickened, crops were devoured. Their people cried out to the gods, but none answered. They weren’t listening. But someone heard them.’” • “Myrna interrupts him, claiming that Catty is just an old wive’s tale to keep kids out of the woods at night. Torrance insists that she’s real.” • “After the brief exchange, Torrance continues his tale. ‘One night a great fog rolled in. Then the cats came. Dozens of them. Then hundreds. That’s when the massacre started.’” • “’The rat blood flowed like rivers though the streets of Khashton. But the next morning, when the villagers saw the massacred rodents, they cried foul. And when Catty showed up to collect what was due, they drove her out of town.’” • “’Catty warned them, but they insist they didn’t ask for her help. She countered that they asked anyone for help. And she helped. She would have what’s hers.’” • “’The townsfolk tried to appeal to her sense of fairness, insisting that helping folks down on their luck was the right thing to do.’” • “’This plea for justice fell on deaf ears, and was the tipping point that ended Khashton. She left. But the cat’s stayed. They say they’re the only residents left of Khashton, them and the bleached bones of the townsfolk.’” • “Hector pipes up, ‘What did she ask for? What was her price?’” • “Torrance looks puzzled. ‘To be honest, no one ever knew that part of the story.’ Myrna snorts, ‘Yeah, because it’s all poppycock. I heard a version where she turned everyone in the town into ratfolk. It’s preposterous.’” Catty does, in fact, reside in these woods. The rest of his facts are specious at best—except about the cats. Once you’ve told the story of Catty Goutfinger, if no one else has any stories to tell, you can continue to part 3. PART 3: CATTYWAMPUS This portion of the journey has the heroes negotiating for safe passage through the woods with an enterprising hag, who sees paydirt in those medicine crates and wants them for herself. • “The wagon enters a dense wood right around sunset. as a thick fog rolls in. Torrance seems on edge, while Myrna is dismissive of his concerns about hags” • “The forest is oddly silent, other than soft buzzing sound almost like a cat’s purr. After about an hour the wagon comes to a stop at a crossroads with a rickety sign pointing in four directions. All of them, read ‘Broadhurst.’” No matter which direction they go they end up back at the crossroads after about an hour. Read or paraphrase the following aloud: • “As you approach the crossroads yet again you start to see cats trailing the wagon at the edge of the fog.” • “A tall and spindly woman, with skin hanging off her elongated bones stands under the sign. Despite the patina of filth covering her, her clothes are exquisitely designed fashion from a bygone era. She’s not quite the terrifying vision described by Torrance, but there is an air of calculating menace about her.” • “She locks eyes with you, one by one, and with a buttery, smooth voice she says, ‘Sweet children, you’re looking lost. Are you lost?’”

##### CATTY GOUTFINGER

The legends are true! Mostly. Catty appreciates the air of mystique the stories about her provide, but she’s so old that she can’t really remember which ones are actually true. Catty loves nothing more than to bargain, but she only cares if the stakes are life, death, or permanent injury because those are good motivators. And she likes a motivated negotiator. They’re more easily plied. The goatpox in Broadhurst presents a unique opportunity to bring an entire town under her peculiar brand of protection. But so far, she’s been unsuccessful in creating a cure. She can smell the medicine on the cart, and she wants it. And once she has it, the farmers of Broadhurst will have no choice but to deal with her.

##### NEGOTIATING FOR PASSAGE

Catty offers to lead the heroes through the fog for a price. She wants those crates, and she doesn’t want to hear any sob stories or pleas for fairness. The medicine is getting to Broadhurst either way, but only through Catty if she gets her way. If the heroes refuse to negotiate with Catty or attack her, she cackles and retreats into the mist, leaving them alone. They must navigate the fog in a montage test instead.

##### CATTY GOUTFINGER NEGOTIATION STATS

Interest: 2 • Patience: 3 • Impression: 2

##### Native Language: Yllric


##### Motivations

• Power: She’s usually called in to clear a child’s flu or mend a horse’s broken limb. Small potatoes. This goatpox affects the entire village and would put her in a unique position to bring its entire population under her influence. Arguments that provide options for her to feel powerful without losing face appeal to this motivation. • Protection: Catty relies on the people of Broadhurst to make her deals and gain knowledge and power. She wants to keep the village intact. If the heroes argue that their delivery of the medicine is better for the overall health of the village or make a similar argument, they appeal to this motivation.

##### Pitfalls

**Justice: Catty:** has no sense of fairness or justice at all. Even appealing to it is insulting. She has far more respect for those that outwit or out bargain her than anyone pleading for fairness. If the heroes try to appeal to her sense of fairness or morality, they run afoul of this pitfall. As the heroes make arguments to Illwyth, she responds based on her interest: • Interest 5: Catty is so impressed with their arguments that she offers to escort the heroes out of the woods, free of charge. She also throws in a Mirror Token and a
**Thunderhead Cloud:** (see Treasures). She gives a warning. “Goblins have been terrorizing the lands around Broadhurst for some time now. If they weren’t such good customers, I’d consider getting rid of them.” • Interest 4: Catty is impressed. She hasn’t come out on the bottom of a negotiation in quite a while. She agrees to show the heroes the way out of the woods, free of charge. • Interest 3: Catty acquiesces on the medicine but demands a price be paid. One hero must relinquish a portion of their life force (all their remaining recoveries) and she will lead them out of the woods. If the hero has no recoveries remaining, they can’t make this deal. • Interest 2: She demands a single crate in exchange for safe passage. • Interest 1: Catty is unmoved and demands every crate on the wagon. If they only have 1 crate she also demands a portion of one hero’s life force. • Interest 0: Catty tired of this game and slinks back into the fog, along with her cats. As the heroes attempt to find their way out, every time they fail a test in the Montage Test: The Fog, the wagon loses 1 crate. If the heroes end the negotiation with Catty’s interest at 4 or higher and make a deal with her, they each gain 1

##### Victory.

If Catty has agreed to escort the heroes out of the fog, she disappears into the fog with her cats. Then read or paraphrase the following aloud: • “A small grey cat, with a tail hooked like question mark, slinks out of the fog and sits in front of the wagon, waiting for you to move.” • “Torrance nudges the horse forward. You follow the cat for about five minutes before the fog breaks and the woods are behind you. The cat meows, pawing at the side of the cart like it’s asking for a tip.” If the heroes decide to attack Catty she uses the Wode Hag stat block, and will retreat into the fog if reduced to 100 Stamina or less.
**MONTAGE TEST:** : THE FOG If the heroes eschewed negotiation or failed to make a deal with Catty, they must make their way through the thick maze of magical fog on their own. The success and failure limits of this test are listed on the Fog Test Difficulty table.

##### SETTING THE SCENE

• “The further you go down the road the thicker the fog gets. Hours of boredom pass, and morale is collapsing among your patrons.” • “Wolves stalk the cart from the fog’s edge and the horse is terrified. But you start to notice repeated patterns depending on which direction you go.”

##### Navigate, Search, Track


##### MONTAGE TEST O UTCOMES

The montage test has the following outcomes:
**Total Success::** The fog breaks quickly, and the heroes find themselves passing a roadside spring with medicinal herbs growing around it. The heroes gain 1 crate of medicine and 1 Victory each.
**Partial Success::** The heroes eventually make it out past the tree line to a safe place to rest. The heroes may choose whether each hero loses 1 Recovery or the wagon takes 5 damage.
**Total Failure: Exhausted:** by a week of bad weather followed by an all-night march through the fog, the heroes finally break the tree line. The Director decides if each hero loses 2 Recoveries or the wagon takes 10 damage.
**PART FOUR:** : BUCK’ SR IDGE RUN The Jagged Edge goblin bandits have laid an ambush for unsuspecting travelers, utilizing a small pass a few miles outside of Broadhurst. Read or paraphrase the following aloud: • “The rain has picked up once again, muddying the road.” • “Up ahead, the road passes through a small wooded ridge line. Torrance says, ‘Buck’s Ridge, last landmark before we hit the farmlands around Broadhurst.’” This encounter uses the Buck’s Ridge Run map.

##### SEARCHING FOR GOBLINS

If the heroes head into Buck’s Ridge without caution, the goblins ambush them in an attempt to kill them and loot the wagon. Proceed to Battling Goblin Bandits. Any hero searching for trouble as they enter the pass should make an Intuition test. The hero who gets the highest result determines the outcome for the group: • ≤11: The heroes don’t notice the goblins and are surprised at the start of the encounter in Battling Goblins
**Bandits. Flame:** walls 1 and 2 appear in front and behind the wagon as goblin archers ignite oil slicks on the ground. • 12-16: The heroes and goblins notice each other at the same time. No one is surprised. A flame wall 1 appears in front of the wagon as goblin archers ignite an oil slick. • 17+: The heroes notice the goblins before the goblins notice them. The goblins are surprised at the start of the encounter in Battling Goblin Bandits. A flame wall(1) a ppears at the start of the second round of combat. If the heroes are surprised by the goblin ambush read the following aloud: • “ Piercing screams and angry words surround you.” • “Suddenly flaming arrows roll down the hill and in front of and behind you, igniting oil slicks that create a wall of flame on either side of the wagon.” Once the heroes have been made aware of the goblins, read or paraphrase the following aloud: • “Goblins holler angrily from the ridge.” • “A volley of arrows rains down, targeting you.”

##### BATTLING GOBLIN BANDITS

The goblins have the heroes right where they want them! They want what’s on that wagon, but unlike the ratfolk, these goblins have no compunctions about killing. There are six goblin warriors, eight goblin snipers, and four goblin stinkers on the ridges, and four goblin assassins in the bushes on either side of the road.

##### Raiders Groups


##### Group Creatures

1 Three goblin warriors 2 Three goblin warriors 3 One goblin stinker One goblin stinker (captain) Four goblin snipers (minion group) 4 One goblin stinker One goblin stinker (captain) Four goblin snipers (minion group) 5 Two goblin assassins 6 Two goblin assassins

##### ENCOUNTER A DJUSTMENTS

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make the following adjustments: • For six heroes, add two goblin stinkers as their own group. • For four heroes, remove two goblin warriors, one from each group. • For three heroes, remove two goblin warriors and two goblin stinkers, each on from a different group.

##### UNHEROIC TRIO

**Torrance, Myrna,:** and Hector drive the wagon out of the pass as quick as they can. If the wagon has 0 Stamina or crates and takes damage during this encounter, one of the NPCs is killed instead of a crate being destroyed: first Torrance, then Hector, then Myrna.

##### THE MEDICINE WAGON

The goal of this encounter is to get the wagon through
**Buck’s Ridge.:** The following rules apply, in addition to the rules on the handout, to the wagon in this encounter. • The wagon’s speed is 8 if it is light, 6 if it is medium, and 4 if it is heavy. It moves forward, toward the east end of the map, at the end of each round. • When it has 0 Stamina it is exposed and cannot move until it is repaired. Whenever the wagon takes damage while it is exposed, a crate it carries is destroyed. • A hero can use a main action to perform a quick field repair when the wagon has 0 stamina. Roll a d6. The wagon regains that much stamina

##### FLAME WALL

The goblins have laid down an oil slick which they ignite in the encounter, creating a fire wall that deals 5 damage to all creatures and objects that pass through it or start their turn in it. A hero can use their main action to douse 1 square of the fire.

##### TACTICS

During the first round, the goblins use the Goblin Mode malice feature at the start of their first turn. The warriors move down from the ridge, attempting to surround the wagon within the fire walls while the snipers and stinkers pelt the heroes from either side of the ridges. If they don’t have to use the Charge main action, each uses the Bury the Point main action until you run out of Malice. Once the wagon passes fire wall 1 (assuming the heroes didn’t surprise the goblins), the assassins emerge and try to hobble the wagon while the warriors, and ranged goblins keep the heroes occupied. The goblins attempt to block the wagon and keep it from escaping while they engage the heroes.

##### ENDING THE ENCOUNTER

Each group of goblins fights until there is one in the group, who then flees. Once all goblins have fled or are defeated, the encounter ends, and each hero earns 1 Victory. Alternatively, if the wagon moves off the map, the heroes have successfully evaded the goblins and can safely make their way to Broadhurst, and each hero earns 1 Victory.

##### GOBLIN MALICE MALICE FEATURES

At the start of any goblin’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.
**Goblin Mode:** ◆ 3 Malice Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

##### EPILOGUE

With the days of rain and mud quickly receding behind the heroes, they make their way into the agrarian township of

##### Broadhurst.

Depending on how heavy with crates the wagon is determines the final reward. If they have 5 or more crates, each hero becomes a Local Hero and gains that title. If they have 2-4 crates, they get 1 Healing Potion for each hero and Myrna teaches them the recipe to make more. If they have 1 crate, Myrna teaches them the recipe to make

##### Healing Potions.

If the wagon is empty or the NPCs are all dead, the heroes get nothing. If the NPCs are alive, they thank the heroes, say their goodbyes, and head to Torrance’s family farm at the other end of town.
