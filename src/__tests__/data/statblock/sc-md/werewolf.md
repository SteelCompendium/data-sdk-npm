##### Solo Monster

**Solo Turns:** The werewolf takes up to two turns each round. They can’t take turns consecutively.
**End Effect:** At the end of their turn, the werewolf can take 5 damage to end one save ends effect affecting them. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.

##### Shapeshifter

The werewolf enters combat in their hybrid humanoid form. Their shape can’t change via any effects beyond their own ability.

##### Shared Ferocity

The Director gains 1d3 malice the first time a creature uses an ability that costs ferocity while within line of effect of the werewolf.

##### Accursed Rage

The werewolf’s ferocity is expressed through rage. Their abilities are capable of inflicting rage points on enemies (excluding stormwight furies). If a creature has 10 or more rage at the start of their turn, they expend all of their rage, shift up to their speed towards the nearest creature, and make a melee free strike against them. A creature that takes damage in this way gains 1 rage. All accumulated rage disappears after completing a respite.

##### Vukenstep

The werewolf ignores difficult terrain.
