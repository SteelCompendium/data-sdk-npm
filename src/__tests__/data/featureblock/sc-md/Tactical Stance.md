###### Tactical Stance (Ajax Feature)

At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Insurgent**
> 
> Ajax automatically treats his initial power roll as a 17. He can still roll to determine if he scores a critical hit.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Mastermind**
> 
> Before he uses an ability, Ajax can either shift up to 2 squares, or can cause one creature within line of effect to slide up to 2 squares, ignoring stability.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Vanguard**
> 
> Ajax has damage immunity 5. Additionally, any enemy who makes a power roll that includes Ajax as a target has a double bane on the roll.
