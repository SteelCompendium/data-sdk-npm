###### Angry Beehive (Level 2 Hazard Hexer)

This beehive is full of angry bees who swarm and attack with little provocation.

- **EV:** 2
- **Stamina:** 3
- **Size:** 1S

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Deactivate**
>
> The beehive can't be deactivated. If it takes damage or is destroyed, the hive unleashes a swarm of bees.

<!-- -->
> ❕ **Activate**
>
> A creature enters the hive's space or an adjacent space without shifting.
>
> **Effect:** The hive is removed from the encounter map and a swarm of bees is placed in one square of the space of the triggering creature. Any creature who starts their turn in the swarm's space takes 3 poison damage. At the start of each round, the swarm moves 1 square and its size increases by 1 square (to 2 squares by 2 squares, 3 squares by 3 squares, and so forth), preferring squares in a creature's space. After 3 rounds, the swarm dissipates.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Upgrades**
>
> **Concealed Hive (+1 EV):** The hive is hidden until the swarm is unleashed.
>
> **Killer Bees (+2 EV):** The bees are a particularly aggressive and dangerous species. The hive triggers even if a creature shifts into or while adjacent to it, and the swarm deals 1d6 + 3 poison damage.
