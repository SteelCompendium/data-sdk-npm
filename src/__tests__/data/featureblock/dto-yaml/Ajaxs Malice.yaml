  - name: Reason
    icon: üë§
    cost: 2 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: Ajax attempts to instill doubt into a creature within line of effect
          through logic and reason. The creature and Ajax make an opposed Reason
          test. If Ajax wins, he chooses to either deal 11 extra damage to one
          target on his next strike or to gain an additional triggered action
          during the current round. Ajax can't use this feature against the same
          creature during the same encounter.

    effects:
      - effect: Until the end of the round, Ajax chooses one of the following
          environments he has previously visited and overlays that environment
          on top of the encounter map, temporarily merging multiple realities.
      - effect: The winds whip and bluster. Any creature who can't fly takes a ‚àí3
          penalty to stability, and forced movement effects gain a +3 bonus to
          their distance against such creatures.
        name: Incredibly High Above the Ground
      - effect: The ground is difficult terrain for enemies. Any creature who starts and
          ends their turn in the same space is restrained (save ends).

      - effect: Ajax then raises his Blade of the Gol King above his head as four giant
          blades emerge from the ground to fill the area. Each target is pushed
          into an unoccupied space adjacent to the area after the power roll is
          resolved. Each blade blocks line of effect and can be dismissed by
          Ajax at will (no action required).
