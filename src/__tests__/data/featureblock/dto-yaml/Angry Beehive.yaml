    effects:
      - effect: A creature enters the hive's space or an adjacent space without
          shifting.
      - name: Effect
        effect: The hive is removed from the encounter map and a swarm of bees is placed
          in one square of the space of the triggering creature. Any creature
          who starts their turn in the swarm's space takes 3 poison damage. At
          the start of each round, the swarm moves 1 square and its size
          increases by 1 square (to 2 squares by 2 squares, 3 squares by 3
          squares, and so forth), preferring squares in a creature's space.
          After 3 rounds, the swarm dissipates.
